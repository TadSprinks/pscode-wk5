// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Procedure Calculate_Sum(A, B)
    Sum = A + B
    Output Sum
End Procedure
Copy
In this pseudocode:
    Calculate Sum is the procedure name.
    A and B are the inputs.
    Sum is a variable that stores the result of A + B.
    Output Sum displays the result.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Procedure Check_Even_Odd(X)
    If X mod 2 equals 0 Then
        Output "Even"
    Else
        Output "Odd"
    End If
End Procedure
Copy
In this pseudocode:
•	Check_Even_Odd is the procedure name.
•	X is the input.
•	X mod 2 equals 0 checks if the remainder of  X divided by 2 is 0. If it is, then X is even.
•	Output "Even" or Output "Odd" displays whether the number is even or odd.











// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   

Initialize an empty list, numbers
For i from 1 to 5 do
    Print "Enter number " + i + ":"
    Read input Number from the user
    Append input Number to the list, numbers
End For

This pseudocode will prompt the user to enter a number five times, and each number will be stored in the list numbers. 

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Initialize a variable, total, to 0
For each number in the list, numbers do
    Add number to total
End For

Calculate average as total divided by the length of the list, numbers
Print "The average of the numbers is: " + average
 
This pseudocode will calculate the sum of all numbers in the list numbers and then divide it by the count of numbers (which is 5 in this case) to get the average. 












c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

Initialize a variable, minNumber, to the first number in the list, numbers
Initialize a variable, maxNumber, to the first number in the list, numbers

For each number in the list, numbers do
    If number is less than minNumber then
        Set minNumber to number
    EndIf

    If number is greater than maxNumber then
        Set maxNumber to number
    EndIf
EndFor

Print "The smallest number is: " + minNumber
Print "The largest number is: " + maxNumber

This pseudocode will iterate through each number in the list numbers, updating minNumber and maxNumber as it finds new minimum and maximum values. 






















d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Initialize an empty list, numbers
For i from 1 to 5 do
    Print "Enter number " + i + ":"
    Read inputNumber from the user
    Append inputNumber to the list, numbers
End For

Initialize a variable, total, to 0
For each number in the list, numbers do
    Add number to total
End For

Calculate average as total divided by the length of the list, numbers
Print "The average of the numbers is: " + average

Initialize a variable, minNumber, to the first number in the list, numbers
Initialize a variable, maxNumber, to the first number in the list, numbers

For each number in the list, numbers do
    If number is less than minNumber then
        Set minNumber to number
    EndIf

    If number is greater than maxNumber then
        Set maxNumber to number
    EndIf
EndFor

Print "The smallest number is: " + minNumber
Print "The largest number is: " + maxNumber

This pseudocode will prompt the user to enter a number five times, calculate the average of these numbers, and find the minimum and maximum values. It will then print out these results with appropriate messages.
